# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## Description
This project demonstrates the ability to collect, clean, and create a tidy dataset
from the UCI HAR Dataset (Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones).  
The goal is to produce a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Files in this repository
- `run_analysis.R` : R script that:
  - Merges the training and test datasets
  - Extracts measurements on the mean and standard deviation
  - Uses descriptive activity names
  - Appropriately labels the dataset with descriptive variable names
  - Creates a second tidy dataset with averages for each subject and activity
- `tidy_dataset.txt` : Final tidy dataset generated by `run_analysis.R`.
- `CodeBook.md` : Describes all variables, their units, and any transformations performed.
- `README.md` : This file, explaining the project and how to use it.

## How to use the script
1. Open RStudio.  
2. Set your working directory to the folder containing the unzipped **UCI HAR Dataset**.  
3. Run `run_analysis.R`.  
4. The script will generate `tidy_dataset.txt` with the processed and summarized data.

## Packages used
- `dplyr` : for data manipulation and summarization.

## Notes
- Ensure that all files from the original UCI HAR Dataset are in the correct folder structure:
